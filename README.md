# YOLOv3_Animals_Detection
Detection of animals in a given image using YOLOv3, Keras &amp; Tensorflow

Used yolov3.weights as pre-trained weights for creating the model.
Execute the make_model.ipynb and use the yolov3.weights file to create the model then run the Image_Prediction file in which we import the .h5 model file to the code and use the image file for classification of animals present in the image. 

We are running the MS-COCO dataset which classifies 10 types of animals and the code creates a bounding box around the animal in the image along with the accuracy of the prediction.
